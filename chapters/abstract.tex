Twisted bilayer graphene (twBLG) has emerged as a highly tunable platform for studying strong electronic correlations. Transport measurements in magic angle twBLG have shown that it exhibits correlated insulator states, superconductivity, ferromagnetism and quantum anomalous Hall effect. Tunneling measurements throw light on the band structure and help understand the scattering processes in a two-dimensional electron gas.  In this thesis, we discuss the fabrication of twBLG heterostructure for tunneling. We perform transport measurements in the device and find it has a low twist angle between the graphene layers.
