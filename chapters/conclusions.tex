\section{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We explored the emerging field of twistronics, through theory and paper discussions.
	\item We learnt fabrication of 2D heterostructures: mechanical exfoliation and tranfer process
	\item We learnt transport and tunneling measurement in twBLG device.
\end{itemize}

\section{Future work possible}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fabricate more twBLG tunnel devices with different twist angles to explore their transport and tunneling properties.
	\item The stack which we measured is expected to have a low angle, which is being explored by performing low temperature transport and thermo-electric measurements.
	\item Fabricate twBLG tunnel device with $WSe_2$ as tunneling barrier as it is not too transparent or opaque and has a favorable band alignment with graphene.
\end{itemize}
